# AngularJS - Angular Egg (ngEgg)

Angular Egg by [Scriptwerx](http://www.scriptwerx.io) is an AngularJS Directive implementation of [egg.js](https://github.com/mikeflynn/egg.js) by Mike Flynn.

## Description

Provides a simple directive which allows you to easily add web easter eggs by watching the user's key strokes.

## Dependencies

Angular Egg depends on *angular.js*, and is tested on version 1.3.14.

## Installation

Angular Egg is packaged as a bower component; to install use:

	bower install angular-egg

You can of course; download the directive from the [git repository](https://github.com/scriptwerx/angular-egg).

## Usage

Simply add the Angular Egg asset to your project and include it in your HTML or as part of your build process.

	<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-egg.min.js"></script>

*angular-egg.js* should appear after *angular.js* is included. Prefer minified assets (.min) for production.

	angular
	    .module('myApp', ['ngEgg']);

Now that *ngEgg* is available within your application; you can make use of it within your DOM as follows:

	<!-- EASTER EGG -->
	<section data-ng-egg data-ng-model="vm.eggActivated">
		YOU FOUND THE EGG!
	</section>
	
	<!-- ACTUAL CONTENT (hidden when egg is activated) -->
	<section data-ng-if="!vm.eggActivated">
		WELCOME TO MY APP
	</section>

You can change the custom keystrokes required to activate the Easter Egg by including the *keycode* attribute within your DOM element:

	<!-- EASTER EGG -->
	<section data-ng-egg data-keycode="up,up,down,down" data-ng-model="vm.eggActivated">
		YOU FOUND THE EGG!
	</section>

You need to pass the character sequence as a comma-delimited String.

Weâ€™re making use of *ngModel* in our directive to include a simple *true/false* switch that can be useful within your app to determine when/if the egg is activated.

**N.B. Angular Egg will automatically hide itself and set the value switch via *ngModel* to false.**
